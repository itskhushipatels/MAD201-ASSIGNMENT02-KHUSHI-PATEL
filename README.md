Personal Expense Tracker App

This is a simple Flutter app for tracking personal expenses. Users can add new expenses, view a list of all expenses, and see detailed information for each expense.

The code is structured to keep the app organized and easy to understand:

models/ – Contains the Expense class, which defines each expense with properties like title, amount, description, and date.

screens/ – Includes separate screens for the home page, adding a new expense, and viewing expense details. Each screen handles its own layout and user interactions.

main.dart – The entry point of the app, which sets up navigation between screens and initializes the app state.

The app demonstrates key Flutter concepts such as:

State management for updating the UI when expenses are added

Form handling with input validation

Navigation between multiple screens

Clean and simple UI design

This project is a good example of organizing a small Flutter app with clear separation of concerns, making it easy to extend or modify in the future.
